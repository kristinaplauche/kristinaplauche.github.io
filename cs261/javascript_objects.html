                The output from these buttons, but this took hours and hours to figure out. I have a much more solid grasp of JavaScript
                Objects now.</p>
            <h3>Dimensions of a Cube</h3>
            <p>I created a simple "Cube" object with properties of length, width, and height. For simplicity, I hard coded the
                values, but the values could come dynamically through various methods.
            </p>
            <button type="button" onclick="writeProp()" class="btn-success">Show Cube Dimensions</button>
            <div id="writeProp"></div>
            <h3>Object with Inheritance</h3>
            <p>I'm calling this a "layered" object, because one of the properties in this object is actually an object inherited
                from another instance. I wanted to create a function that would display the properties and values of an object
                dynamically. I used a for loop and a for/in loop to get this to display the way I wanted. Click the button
                below to see the magic. </p>
            <button type="button" onclick="writeLayer()" class="btn-success">Show the Layered Object</button>
            <div id="writeLayer"></div>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                <strong>FYI:</strong> I used console.log a lot for learning purposes. You may want to check it out to see what is
                there.

                <h2>Properties</h2>
                <p>A property of an object is the name of the attribute. For example if I had a car object with the make of
                    Honda,
                    <strong>car.make</strong> would be the property. </p>
                <p>Syntax is: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        objectName.property // car.make
                    </li>
                    <li>objectName["property"] // car["make"]</li>
                    <li>objectName[expression] // x = "make"; car.x</li>
                    <p>You can think of an object property like a variable that "belongs" to the object. Property names can
                        be dynamically determined. Dynamic property names needs to use square brackets [].
                    </p>

                <h2>Methods</h2>
                <p>Methods are when a function is a property of an object. Rather than having an object of Character {"first
                    name": "Mama", "last name": "Bear","full name": "Mama Bear"}, we can make "full name" a function like
                    this: </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>fullName: function () { return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName; }
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h3>This displays:
                    <strong>
                        <span id="showMethod"></span>
                    </strong>
                </h3>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#Inheritance">From MDN:</a> All objects in JavaScript inherit from at least one other object. The object being inherited
                    from is known as the prototype, and the inherited properties can be found in the prototype object of
                    the constructor. In the screenshot below, the Instructor function is the prototype for future objects.
                    Objects created as new instances of Instructor will inherit the properties of name, age, and gender from
                    this function.</p>

                <h2>Constructor functions</h2>
                <p>The prototype is a constructor function. This allows you to create an instance of this object with the word
                    new.

                <h2>Object.creation</h2>

                <p>Object.create is very useful because it allows you to use the prototype object to create a new object without
                    having to define a constructor function. You can see a screenshot of my code.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Check the console to see the out put of this function.</strong>

                <h2>Aha! Moment</h2>
                <p>One of my big realizations while studying this subject is that much of the built-in functions we use in JavaScript
                    are objects. For example DOM is the Document
                    <em>Object</em> Model. Things like Number, Math, and Date are also objects. Those words perform functions
                    when concatenated to other words because those words represent
                    <em>objects</em>. Aha! This is important to know!
                </p>
